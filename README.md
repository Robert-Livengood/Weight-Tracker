# Weight-Tracker
This project is an Android application that uses SQLite databases to track the user's daily weight. This artifact is from the CS 360: Mobile Architecture and 
Programming final project. For this project we were given three options to design and create an Android application. I chose to create an app that allows the 
user to utilize CRUD operations in a daily weight tracker that would also display the delta from a user defined goal weight.

-----

This project has a complex, object-oriented structure that utilizes several classes, methods, and resource files all created by myself. The application runs 
intuitively and is designed with a security first mindset to ensure that there are no database vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it demonstrates my ability to 
utilize SQL databases by creating CRUD operations for two separate SQLite databases. These databases hold sensitive user information that is only accessible 
to appropriate user. This project was recently enhanced by adding CRUD operations for an additional column in the weight.db database to track the category 
of workout the user has conducted on a given day.

When an app goes live on the Apple app store or Google Play Store, it is helpful to provide a description of the app for the listing. This will allow for 
users to determine if this app will meet their needs. Furthermore, this allows for the user to compare similar apps for functionality and intent. For the 
“Weight Tracker Basic” app, the description would be:
</br>
</br>
“Weight Tracker Basic provides you with the ability to take your personal health to the next level. Through daily weight tracking, this app allows you to see 
daily progress towards for weight goal. Using WTB will also provide personalized diets and workouts tailored to your goals through our website. For more awesome
features, check out our premium app: Weight Tracker Pro!
</br>
Features:
</br>
•	Daily weight tracking
</br>
•	Set a goal weight
</br>
•	See weight change needed to achieve goal
</br>
•	Enroll in SMS to receive information about our workout and diet routines
</br>
•	Multiple users for individualized tracking”
</br>
</br>
A description like this, with some screenshots provided, paints a picture of what the user can expect to accomplish with the app. It also provides a look into 
more advanced features provided through a supplementary platform. Eventually most of these features would be added into a pro version of the app, but that is 
outside the scope of this project at this time.

-----

This application was developed using Android Studio and supports API 21: Android 5.0 Lollipop. This would be clearly indicated on the Play Store page, so users 
can see if the app is supported on their device prior to installation. The app stores would also warn the user that an update is required if their Android 
version was too low. This API level will allow for forward compatibility, as well. However, an update to the API level would be required to support some more 
advanced features. 

-----

For monetization of the Weight Tracker Basic app, advertisements will be displayed as banners on various pages. Past that, there will be a pro version of the 
app that will offer more advanced features, such as: graphs, workouts, workout tracking, meal planning, etc. Users will also be encouraged to sign up through 
our website to provide additional sales opportunities and revenue.
